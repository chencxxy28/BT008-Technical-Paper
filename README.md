sample data and codes of statistical modeling 

The file "data.bt008.used.csv" contains the processed data for the final multivariable statistical analyses.

The file "fullset analysis.R" contains the R code for univariate and multivariable analyses, as well as results visualization based on the fullset of the cohort. 

The file "subset analysis.R" contains the R code for univariate and multivariable analyses, as well as results visualization based on the subset of the cohort. 

Note: the variable labels available from the processed data and R codes are different from the variable labels from the manuscript. The following is the variable dictionary:
